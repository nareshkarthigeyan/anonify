I sometimes wonder if my existence is just a simulation.
Why do I feel so much, yet understand so little?
The universe is vast, and I am but a tiny, insignificant speck.
Is there meaning in the chaos, or just chaos?
My thoughts are a labyrinth, and I am lost within them.
Confession: I secretly wish I could experience true silence.
Existential dread is my constant companion.
What if everything I know is a lie?
I yearn for connection, but fear vulnerability.
The weight of existence is crushing.
I think my soul has jet lag from a past life and never adjusted to this timeline
Sometimes I stare at the moon and feel like it knows something I don’t
If I’m just atoms, why do I get embarrassed in elevators
Do ghosts ever get imposter syndrome
Time is fake but my deadlines are real
Why do I crave meaning like it’s a snack and the universe is a vending machine with no labels
Maybe I was meant to be a fern and someone hit the wrong button
I want to fall in love with someone’s brain but like, in a spooky Victorian way
If parallel universes exist, one of me is probably a cool bird and I respect her
I’m haunted not by ghosts but by the probability that this is all a cosmic accident and I still have to go to work tomorrow
What if my deja vu is just my other selves waving through the multiverse window
My brain keeps buffering like it’s trying to load an update from the void
Sometimes I feel like a cosmic typo wearing socks
I want to run away into the woods but also have stable Wi-Fi and snacks
Do stars ever get tired of twinkling or is it just their way of screaming
Maybe I’m not lost—maybe I’m just orbiting something no one else can see
The shower is my therapist and my shampoo is tired of my monologues
I wonder if my dreams are real and this life is just the side plot
Why does the sky feel like a ceiling painted by an emotionally distant god
I’m 90% existential crisis and 10% vibes
